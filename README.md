Forker
======

Forker will be a website where programmers can collaborate socially and with code. It's an attempt to combine both the social and professional aspects of software development.

More importantly than that Forker is an attempt to teach many of the students at UCR about import things like web concepts, design patterns, system administration, collaboration, working remotely, security issues, and the many other odds and ends of web development.

Getting Involved
================
One the biggest requirements of Forker is the ability to get involved easily. I will be posting several tutorials based on the needs of students. I will also be hosting several meetings to discuss how and what this is going to be.

It's a big concern to me so please do your part and contribute.

Before We Start
===============
Before we start development it would be really helpful if everyone took the time took the time to learn about using [git](http://www.vogella.com/articles/Git/article.html), [github](http://zachholman.com/talk/how-github-uses-github-to-build-github/), [github APIs](http://developer.github.com/v3/), [diaspora*](https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora), [gitlab](https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq), [heroku](http://www.heroku.com/), and [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) as we may or may not use more than one of these. Please come to me with questions.

More fanciness may come later like [jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/) and even facebook integration.
